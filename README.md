**Project Overview**

This project involves using a Raspberry Pi Pico W to build a simple echo sounder with the Airmar DT800 transducer. The goal is to:

1. Display Depth Data: Read depth data transmitted via an RS485 cable and display it on a small LCD screen.
2. Store Data: Save the depth data in real-time to an SD card.
3. Export Data: Output the depth data to a serial port through a DB9 connector for integration with computer programs such as Hypack, HydroPro, or Hydromagic.
